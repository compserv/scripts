Hi,

Before you're added to the suicidal mailing list, we'd like to remind you that suicidal gets emails sent to EVERY committee. This is approximately 20 distinct email threads per day (about 50 individual emails). If you're interested in getting emails for a specific committee or committees, we could add you as an auditor for those mailing lists.

If you would still like to be added to suicidal, please respond with 'YES, I, {}, WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED.'

Thanks,
-Compserv
