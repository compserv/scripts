Hi Bridge,

This is your humble servant, FlickrBot. I regret to inform you that
some of the events in the flickr/pictures directory are not correctly
formatted. As a reminder, the correct format is:
MMDD-CAMELCASEDEVENTNAME
E.g. flickr/pictures/Sp14/0307-CandidateIceCream.

The following directories are incorrectly formatted:
%s

Please rename these directories. They will be uploaded
the next time I am activated.

Forever loyal,
FlickrBot
